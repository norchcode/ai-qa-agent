File Processing Enhancement Design for LLM Integration

This document outlines the design for adding file upload and reading functionality
to the AI QA Agent's LLM integration, specifically for Groq API.

## Overview

Since Groq's API doesn't natively support file uploads and reading like OpenAI's API,
we'll implement a workaround by:

1. Adding file reading functionality in our code
2. Converting file contents to text
3. Sending the text to Groq's API
4. Processing the response

## Design Components

### 1. File Handling Interface

We'll extend the LLMProvider abstract base class with new methods for file handling:

```python
@abstractmethod
def process_file(self, file_path: str, prompt: Optional[str] = None, 
                system_prompt: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Process a file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to process.
        prompt: Optional prompt to provide context for processing the file.
        system_prompt: Optional system prompt to provide additional context.
        
    Returns:
        Generated text as a string.
    """
    pass

@abstractmethod
def analyze_code_file(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze a code file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the code file to analyze.
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results.
    """
    pass

@abstractmethod
def extract_test_cases_from_file(self, file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract test cases from a file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to extract test cases from.
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing extracted test cases.
    """
    pass
```

### 2. File Type Detection and Processing

We'll implement a utility class for detecting file types and extracting content:

```python
class FileProcessor:
    """Utility class for processing different file types."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def detect_file_type(file_path: str) -> str:
        """Detect the type of a file based on extension and content."""
        # Implementation details
        
    @staticmethod
    def extract_text_from_file(file_path: str) -> str:
        """Extract text content from a file."""
        # Implementation details for different file types
        
    @staticmethod
    def extract_code_from_file(file_path: str) -> str:
        """Extract code content from a file."""
        # Implementation details
        
    @staticmethod
    def extract_structured_data_from_file(file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract structured data from a file (JSON, YAML, etc.)."""
        # Implementation details
```

### 3. Implementation in GroqProvider

We'll implement the file handling methods in the GroqProvider class:

```python
def process_file(self, file_path: str, prompt: Optional[str] = None, 
                system_prompt: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Process a file using Groq API.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to process.
        prompt: Optional prompt to provide context for processing the file.
        system_prompt: Optional system prompt to provide additional context.
        
    Returns:
        Generated text as a string.
    """
    # Extract text from file
    file_content = FileProcessor.extract_text_from_file(file_path)
    
    # Create prompt with file content
    file_prompt = prompt or "Analyze the following file content:"
    full_prompt = f"{file_prompt}\n\n```\n{file_content}\n```"
    
    # Generate completion
    return self.generate_completion(full_prompt, system_prompt)

def analyze_code_file(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze a code file using Groq API.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the code file to analyze.
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results.
    """
    # Extract code from file
    code_content = FileProcessor.extract_code_from_file(file_path)
    
    # Create system prompt for code analysis
    system_prompt = """
    You are a code analysis expert. Analyze the provided code and return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
        "summary": "Brief summary of what the code does",
        "complexity": "Assessment of code complexity (Low, Medium, High)",
        "issues": ["List of potential issues or bugs"],
        "suggestions": ["List of improvement suggestions"],
        "test_coverage": "Assessment of test coverage or testability"
    }
    """
    
    # Create prompt with code content
    prompt = f"Analyze the following code:\n\n```\n{code_content}\n```"
    
    # Generate completion
    result = self.generate_completion(prompt, system_prompt)
    
    # Parse result as JSON
    try:
        return json.loads(result)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.warning("Failed to parse LLM output as JSON, returning raw output")
        return {"raw_output": result}

def extract_test_cases_from_file(self, file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract test cases from a file using Groq API.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to extract test cases from.
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing extracted test cases.
    """
    # Extract text from file
    file_content = FileProcessor.extract_text_from_file(file_path)
    
    # Create system prompt for test case extraction
    system_prompt = """
    You are a QA expert. Extract test cases from the provided content and return them as a JSON array with the following structure:
    [
        {
            "title": "Test case title",
            "description": "Test case description",
            "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...],
            "expected_results": ["Expected result 1", "Expected result 2", ...],
            "priority": "Priority level (Low, Medium, High)"
        },
        ...
    ]
    """
    
    # Create prompt with file content
    prompt = f"Extract test cases from the following content:\n\n```\n{file_content}\n```"
    
    # Generate completion
    result = self.generate_completion(prompt, system_prompt)
    
    # Parse result as JSON
    try:
        return json.loads(result)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.warning("Failed to parse LLM output as JSON, returning raw output")
        return [{"raw_output": result}]
```

### 4. File Type Support

We'll support the following file types:

1. **Text Files**: .txt, .md, .log, etc.
2. **Code Files**: .py, .js, .java, .cpp, .cs, etc.
3. **Structured Data**: .json, .yaml, .xml, etc.
4. **Documentation**: .pdf, .docx (with appropriate libraries)
5. **Test Files**: .feature (Gherkin), .spec.js, test_*.py, etc.

### 5. Integration with API and Controller

We'll update the API and controller to expose the file processing functionality:

```python
# In api.py
def process_file(self, file_path: str, prompt: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Process a file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to process.
        prompt: Optional prompt to provide context for processing the file.
        
    Returns:
        Generated text as a string.
    """
    return self.controller.llm_provider.process_file(file_path, prompt)

def analyze_code_file(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze a code file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the code file to analyze.
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results.
    """
    return self.controller.llm_provider.analyze_code_file(file_path)

def extract_test_cases_from_file(self, file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract test cases from a file using the LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to extract test cases from.
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing extracted test cases.
    """
    return self.controller.llm_provider.extract_test_cases_from_file(file_path)
```

### 6. Web UI Integration

We'll add file upload components to the Web UI:

```python
# In webui_enhanced.py
with gr.TabItem("File Processing"):
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            file_input = gr.File(label="Upload File")
            file_prompt = gr.Textbox(
                label="Processing Prompt (Optional)",
                placeholder="Enter a prompt to guide the processing..."
            )
            process_file_button = gr.Button("Process File")
        
        with gr.Column():
            file_output = gr.Textbox(
                label="Processing Result",
                lines=15
            )
    
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            code_file_input = gr.File(label="Upload Code File")
            analyze_code_button = gr.Button("Analyze Code")
        
        with gr.Column():
            code_analysis_output = gr.JSON(
                label="Code Analysis Result"
            )
    
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            test_file_input = gr.File(label="Upload Test File")
            extract_tests_button = gr.Button("Extract Test Cases")
        
        with gr.Column():
            test_cases_output = gr.JSON(
                label="Extracted Test Cases"
            )
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **File Size Limits**: We'll need to implement file size checks to avoid token limits.
2. **Chunking**: For large files, we'll implement chunking to process the file in parts.
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file reading and processing errors.
4. **Supported Models**: Document which Groq models work best with file processing.
5. **Performance**: Optimize file processing for performance, especially for large files.

## Dependencies

We'll need to add the following dependencies:

1. **PyPDF2** or **pdfplumber**: For PDF file processing
2. **python-docx**: For Word document processing
3. **beautifulsoup4**: For HTML file processing
4. **chardet**: For character encoding detection

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test file type detection and content extraction
2. **Integration Tests**: Test file processing with Groq API
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test file upload and processing through the Web UI

## Documentation Updates

We'll update the following documentation:

1. **API Documentation**: Add file processing methods
2. **User Guide**: Add file processing usage examples
3. **Web UI Guide**: Add file upload and processing instructions
